# go-micro

go-micro microservice framework template

This is a small template for creating a new microservice in go. 

Its not intended to be a fully featured microservice framework, just a small starting point with the things i normally need to build up a small, fast go microservice.

The project structure depends on this: https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout

Features:

- usage of Opentracing/jaeger
- gelf logging
- authorization with jwt
- cached healthcheck, healthz and readyz endpoints
- https/ssl and http for payload and metrics/healthcheck
- metrics with Prometheus: https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/go-application/
- Docker build with builder and target image
- chi as the router framework
- go 1.17

## Prometheus integration

You can switch on the prometheus integration simply by adding 

```yaml
metrics:
  enable: true
```

to the service config.

### How to add a new counter?

Simply on the class, where you want to add a new counter (or something else) make a new variable with:

```go
var (
  postConfigCounter = promauto.NewCounter(prometheus.CounterOpts{
	 Name: "gomicro_post_config_total",
     Help: "The total number of post config requests",
  })
)
```

In the code where to count the events simply do an



```go
postConfigCounter.Inc()
```

 Thats all. More examples here: https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/go-application/
